BcMq
====

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/braincrafted/mq.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/braincrafted/mq)

An asynchronous message queue implemented in PHP (mostly for fun and pleasure).

By [Florian Eckerstorfer](http://florianeckerstorfer.com).


Installation
------------

The recommended way of installing BcMq is through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

    {
        "require": {
            "braincrafted/mq": "dev-master"
        }
    }


Usage
-----

BcMq requires two distinct scripts, a server and a consumer. The server needs to run as long new messages should be accepted. Whenever a new message arrives the server invokes the consumer in the background and instantley closes the connection.

Messages can be produced using the included producer or by writing a JSON object to the configured port.

There are examples for server, consumer and producer in the `examples` directory.

- [`server.php`](https://github.com/braincrafted/mq/blob/master/examples/server.php)
- [`consumer.php`](https://github.com/braincrafted/mq/blob/master/examples/consumer.php)
- [`producer.php`](https://github.com/braincrafted/mq/blob/master/examples/producer.php)
